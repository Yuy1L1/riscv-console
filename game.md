# Game thoughts

Here are a few things to think about when implementing the game.


## game frame

meaning the rectangle box that the game happens. i.e. 600 px times 200 px.

## dino
the actual character dinosaur that gamers control.

## cactus

serving as obstacle that the dino jumps over it.

## bird
serving as obstacle that the dino dives down to avoid it.


# Gamer control
The gamer controls the dino in two ways. One is jump up, the other is dive down. The dino will **jump up** if the gamer presses the **up** button and **dives down** if the game presses the **down** button.

# Game Rules

- The rule of the game is very simple:
If the touches the cactus or bird, it dies. If not, the game continues.
