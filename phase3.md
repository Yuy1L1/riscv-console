Things we need to have for the next update:
1. firmware folder.
2. app src code.
3. baseline cartridge project, including Makefile, crt0.s, func stubs, header file.
4. Makefile for firmware at least, should be more than that.

TODO:
1. write more func in sprite management
2. create & write memory_management.c and game_state.c
3. write Makefile for interrupt.c cuz current interrupt func is in startup.c
4. crt0.s how to assembly coding?
5. what is stub? not sure, need to ask TA
